== Introduction

Professional documentation is essential for effective knowledge transfer and project success. This guide establishes standards for creating high-quality technical documentation. Following these guidelines ensures consistency and professionalism.

Clear documentation reduces support requests and improves user satisfaction. It serves as a single source of truth for technical information.

== Documentation Standards

This section outlines the core standards for professional documentation. Each standard is designed to improve readability and maintainability.

.Listing 1. Configuration example for documentation tools
[source,yaml]
----
documentation:
  format: asciidoc
  style: professional
  review: mandatory
  version_control: git
----

Standards help maintain consistency across different documents and authors. They provide a framework for quality documentation.

NOTE: All documentation must pass review before publication.

== Writing Guidelines

Technical writing requires clarity and precision. Each sentence should convey exactly one idea. Avoid ambiguous language and jargon.

.Example 1. Clear vs unclear writing
[source,java]
----
// Clear: Check user permissions before processing
if (user.hasPermission("write")) {
    processDocument();
}

// Unclear: Do the thing if okay
if (check()) {
    doIt();
}
----

TIP: Use active voice and present tense for instructions.

|Code References
|Inline Monospace
|Use the `configure()` method

== Code Documentation

Code examples must be complete and functional. Include all necessary imports and dependencies. Provide context for each example.

.Listing 2. Complete code example with context
[source,python]
----
"""
Example: Database connection with error handling
This demonstrates proper resource management
"""
import psycopg2
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def get_db_connection():
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            host="localhost",
            database="myapp",
            user="appuser"
        )
        yield conn
    finally:
        if conn:
            conn.close()
----

IMPORTANT: Always include error handling in production examples.

== Visual Elements

Visual elements enhance understanding and break up text. Use diagrams to illustrate complex concepts. Ensure all images have descriptive captions.

== Quality Assurance

Documentation quality directly impacts user experience. Regular reviews ensure accuracy and completeness. Automated testing catches common issues.

.Listing 3. Documentation validation script
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
# Validate documentation before commit

echo "Running documentation checks..."
asciidoctor-lint *.adoc
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Documentation validation passed"
else
    echo "Fix documentation issues before committing"
    exit 1
fi
----

CAUTION: Never publish documentation without peer review.

== Conclusion

Professional documentation is a critical component of successful software projects. Following established standards ensures consistency and quality. Regular reviews and updates maintain documentation relevance.
