= AsciiDoc Linter - Example Rules and Documents

This directory contains example configurations and sample documents demonstrating different validation rule sets for the AsciiDoc Linter.

== Overview

Each subdirectory contains:

* A YAML configuration file defining validation rules
* A sample AsciiDoc document that can be validated against those rules
* Expected validation results

== Available Examples

=== 1. Basic Rules (`basic/`)

* **Configuration**: `basic-rules.yaml`
* **Sample Document**: `sample-document.adoc`
* **Purpose**: Demonstrates basic validation for general documentation

Features:
- Simple metadata requirements (title, author)
- Basic section structure validation
- Paragraph length limits
- Optional code language specification
- Image alt-text requirements

=== 2. Strict Rules (`strict/`)

* **Configuration**: `strict-rules.yaml`
* **Sample Document**: `professional-document.adoc`
* **Purpose**: Enforces strict standards for professional documentation

Features:
- Comprehensive metadata validation (title, author, version, date, keywords)
- Enforced document structure (Abstract, ToC, Introduction, Conclusion, References)
- Strict naming conventions for figures, tables, and listings
- Sentence count validation
- Required table captions and image dimensions
- Admonition type restrictions

=== 3. Technical Documentation Rules (`technical-docs/`)

* **Configuration**: `technical-docs-rules.yaml`
* **Sample Document**: `api-documentation.adoc`
* **Purpose**: Optimized for API documentation and technical specifications

Features:
- API-specific metadata (api-version, status)
- Enforced sections for API docs (Overview, Authentication, Endpoints)
- HTTP method patterns in section titles
- Required parameter tables with specific column counts
- Language restrictions for code examples
- Response code documentation requirements

== Understanding Validation Results

Each example is designed to demonstrate both passing and failing validations:

=== Expected Results

.Basic Rules Validation
- ✅ PASS: Document has required metadata
- ✅ PASS: Sections have proper titles
- ⚠️ WARN: Some code blocks lack language specification
- ℹ️ INFO: Optional metadata like `revdate` follows correct format

.Strict Rules Validation
- ✅ PASS: All required sections present
- ✅ PASS: Tables and figures properly numbered
- ✅ PASS: Code listings have required titles
- ❌ ERROR: Missing if any required section is absent

.Technical Docs Validation
- ✅ PASS: API endpoints follow REST conventions
- ✅ PASS: Request/response examples provided
- ✅ PASS: Parameter tables have correct structure
- ❌ ERROR: Missing if authentication section absent

== Creating Custom Rules

Use these examples as templates for your own validation rules:

1. Copy a configuration that's closest to your needs
2. Modify the rules according to your requirements
3. Test with your documents
4. Iterate until the validation matches your standards

=== Rule Severity Levels

* **ERROR**: Critical issues that must be fixed
* **WARN**: Important issues that should be addressed
* **INFO**: Suggestions for improvement

== Tips for Rule Development

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic rules and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Iteratively**: Validate frequently during rule development
3. **Document Intent**: Add comments to your YAML explaining why rules exist
4. **Balance Strictness**: Too many rules can hinder productivity
5. **Version Control**: Track rule changes alongside code changes

== Contributing

To add new examples:

1. Create a new subdirectory under `examples/rules/`
2. Add a descriptive configuration file
3. Create a sample document that demonstrates the rules
4. Update this README with the new example
5. Submit a pull request
